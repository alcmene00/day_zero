            A drought is, in short, an area especially hot and dry, which is not
            getting enough rainfall to be able to sustain the life that is
            residing there. Some areas are in a perpetual drought, whereas other
            areas may be dealing with a drought on occasion. Droughts are common
            all over the world that may severely lower the groundwater level
            making it impossible for people to get water from fountains, and
            there is little that can be done to prevent such things from
            happening.

          <p class="text">
            There are a number of remote areas throughout the entire world that
            deal with water scarcity because they just aren’t close to anywhere
            that has water. Areas that are considered to be desert, or areas
            that are secluded, may not have some sources where that the people
            can get water effectively.

            Natural disasters like tsunamis, floods may also cause severe water
            shortages for the local population since important public
            infrastructure may be destroyed. The severe natural disaster may
            entirely collapse the local water supply. Floods may also lead to
            serious pollution of local water bodies as large amounts of soil are
            moved, and after floods, local rivers may no longer be suitable for
            drinking water purposes for a certain period of time.

            Water covers 70% of our planet, and it is easy to think that it will
            always be plentiful. However, freshwater—the stuff we drink, bathe
            in, irrigate our farm fields with—is incredibly rare. Only 3% of the
            world’s water is fresh water, and two-thirds of that is tucked away
            in frozen glaciers or otherwise unavailable for our use.

          <p class="text">
            The first reason that is causing water stress around the world is
            the growing human population at the same time as the water supply
            has remained the same. Given that there are almost one billion more
            inhabitants on Earth every 15-20 years, this has led to a
            progressive deficit in the global water supply.

        <div class="col-md-6">
          <h4 class="titles-h4">Global<br />Warming</h4>
          <p class="text">
            Global warming is another important cause of water scarcity. When
            our average air temperature becomes warmer, water from rivers and
            lakes evaporates faster, which may contribute to the drying up of
            water bodies. Therefore, people who rely on those water bodies for
            drinking water significantly suffer from the consequences of global
            warming, affecting the local water supply.

            Water pollution is a huge problem, especially when you’re looking at
            areas that don’t necessarily have a good sewage system. Pollution
            can be anything from oil, to carcasses, to chemicals, and fecal
            matter. No matter what it is, it makes a lot of issues for the
            people who may need to use it.

            It may be overused on people, animals, land, or any other number of
            things. It may also be used for recreational activities without any
            care about the effects that it may have on the world around them.

          <p class="text">
            Water use has grown at more than twice the rate of the human
            population over the last century in part due to industries, such as
            agriculture, which account for 70% of global freshwater use.

            If there is conflict over an area of land, it may be difficult to
            access the water that is located there. It may lead to the
            destruction of important local infrastructure that may cause
            disruptions of the water supply for many people. People could end up
            dying if they try to access the water in these areas (due to
            violence).

          <p class="text">
            Illegal dumping is another significant reason for water shortages.
            Industries frequently dispose of their industrial garbage into
            nearby rivers and lakes since it is an easy and cheap way to get rid
            of this waste. It leads to serious water pollution, which may result
            in severe water scarcity for people who rely on those water bodies
            for the water supply.

          <h4 class="titles-h4">Governmental<br />Access</h4>

            In some countries, specifically those with dictatorships, the use of
            water may be strictly controlled by those in power, causing a
            scarcity for those who may be located in those areas of the world.
            These governments use it as a source of control over those that they
            are governing, which can be a huge problem.
