    <p class="text">A drought is, in short, an area especially hot and dry, which is not getting enough rainfall to be able to sustain the life that is residing there. Some areas are in a perpetual drought, whereas other areas may be dealing with a drought on occasion. Droughts are common all over the world that may severely lower the groundwater level making it impossible for people to get water from fountains, and there is little that can be done to prevent such things from happening.</p>
    
    <p class="titles-h2">N A T U R A L<br>D I S A S T E R S</p>
    <p class="text">Natural disasters like tsunamis, floods may also cause severe water shortages for the local population since important public infrastructure may be destroyed. The severe natural disaster may entirely collapse the local water supply. Floods may also lead to serious pollution of local water bodies as large amounts of soil are moved, and after floods, local rivers may no longer be suitable for drinking water purposes for a certain period of time.</p>
    
    <p class="titles-h2">D I S T A N C E</p>
    <p class="text">There are a number of remote areas throughout the entire world that deal with water scarcity because they just aren’t close to anywhere that has water. Areas that are considered to be desert, or areas that are secluded, may not have some sources where that the people can get water effectively.</p>

    <p class="text">Water covers 70% of our planet, and it is easy to think that it will always be plentiful. However, freshwater—the stuff we drink, bathe in, irrigate our farm fields with—is incredibly rare. Only 3% of the world’s water is fresh water, and two-thirds of that is tucked away in frozen glaciers or otherwise unavailable for our use.</p>

    <p class="text">The first reason that is causing water stress around the world is the growing human population at the same time as the water supply has remained the same. Given that there are almost one billion more inhabitants on Earth every 15-20 years, this has led to a progressive deficit in the global water supply.</p>
    
    <p class="titles-h2">P O L L U T I O N</p>
    <p class="text">Water pollution is a huge problem, especially when you’re looking at areas that don’t necessarily have a good sewage system. Pollution can be anything from oil, to carcasses, to chemicals, and fecal matter. No matter what it is, it makes a lot of issues for the people who may need to use it.</p>
    
    <p class="titles-h2">G L O B A L<br>W A R M I N G</p>
    <p class="text">Global warming is another important cause of water scarcity. When our average air temperature becomes warmer, water from rivers and lakes evaporates faster, which may contribute to the drying up of water bodies. Therefore, people who rely on those water bodies for drinking water significantly suffer from the consequences of global warming, affecting the local water supply.</p>
    
    <p class="titles-h2">O V E R U S E</p>
    <p class="text">Water overuse is a huge issue that a lot of people are dealing with. It may be overused on people, animals, land, or any other number of things. It may also be used for recreational activities without any care about the effects that it may have on the world around them.</p>

    <p class="text">Water use has grown at more than twice the rate of the human population over the last century in part due to industries, such as agriculture, which account for 70% of global freshwater use.</p>
    
    <p class="titles-h2">C O N F L I C T</p>
    <p class="text">If there is conflict over an area of land, it may be difficult to access the water that is located there. It may lead to the destruction of important local infrastructure that may cause disruptions of the water supply for many people.
People could end up dying if they try to access the water in these areas (due to violence).

    <p class="titles-h2">I L L I G A L<br>D U M P I N G</p>
    <p class="text">Illegal dumping is another significant reason for water shortages. Industries frequently dispose of their industrial garbage into nearby rivers and lakes since it is an easy and cheap way to get rid of this waste. It leads to serious water pollution, which may result in severe water scarcity for people who rely on those water bodies for the water supply.</p>
    
    <p class="titles-h2">G O V E R N M E N T A L<br>A C C E S S</p>
    <p class="text">In some countries, specifically those with dictatorships, the use of water may be strictly controlled by those in power, causing a scarcity for those who may be located in those areas of the world. These governments use it as a source of control over those that they are governing, which can be a huge problem.</p>
