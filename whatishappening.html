            <h3 class="titles">Cape Town - South Africa</h3>
            <p>
              <br />
              The Cape Town water crisis in South Africa was a period of severe
              water shortage in the Western Cape region, most notably affecting
              the City of Cape Town. While dam water levels had been declining
              since 2015, the Cape Town water crisis peaked during mid-2017 to
              mid-2018 when water levels hovered between 15 and 30 percent of
              total dam capacity. <br />
              <br />
              The City of Cape Town introduced increasingly strict restrictions,
              which as well as limiting the volumes allowed, also restricted
              what the water was used for. Filling swimming pools, washing cars,
              and fountains were all banned. Households using high volumes of
              water faced big fines.

              The city also significantly hiked tariffs as well as rolling out
              management devices, which set a daily limit on the water supply to
              properties. Alongside measures targeted at domestic use, Cape Town
              also called on the agricultural and commercial sectors. Hard
              limits on agricultural water quotas were introduced. <br />
              <br />
              <strong>
                While Cape Town’s water crisis was declared a national emergency
                in 2018, today the dams that supply the city with water are
                overflowing. <br />
                <br />
                Day Zero thankfully never came and the city’s largest supplier
                of water, the Theewaterskloof Dam, has seen an impressive
                increase in dam levels; from 11% on March 9, 2018, to 100% on
                Oct. 2, 2020.

            <!-- CHENNAI -->
            
            <h3 class="titles">Chennai - India</h3>
            <p>
              Chennai, with a population of nearly 11 million, has no perennial
              rivers to supply its water. The city is dependent on the
              north-east monsoons and four large reservoirs for its water. But
              reliance on these reservoirs is proving increasingly precarious.
              <br />
              <br />
              Two years of deficient monsoon rainfall, particularly in late 2017
              and throughout much of 2018 had led to this water crisis. A major
              heat wave in India from May to June 2019 further exacerbated the
              problem by evaporating any water still left in reservoirs. <br />
              <br />
              In June 2019, Chennai made international headlines when the city
              officials declared that Day Zero had arrived – the anticipated
              moment when all four of the city's reservoirs ran dry. The crisis
              prompted extreme measures to provide relief, including
              transporting water by rail from a town more than 200km (124 miles)
              away. The last train that carried water into the parched city of
              Chennai rolled out of town Oct. 9, almost four months after
              officials declared the city at “day zero”—with no water for a
              population of more than eight million people.

              For those months, people lined up to get their allotment of water
              brought from the countryside by rail car or by tanker truck.
              Fights broke out, and worldwide attention was focused on this, the
              first major city in the world to go completely dry. <br />
              <br />
              Even in October, though summer rains had filled the city’s four
              reservoirs enough to halt the trains, there were still signs all
              over the city of the water shortages—from multiple water tankers
              still on the roads to warnings at hotels to take short showers.
              With continued rains, Chennai Metrowater officially declared the
              city out of its water shortage Nov. 4 With fewer places to hold
              precipitation, flooding increased. In 2015, Chennai suffered its
              worst inundation in a century. The services of the water train
              were stopped in October when monsoon rains replenished groundwater
              and filled the reservoirs. <br />
              <br />
              <strong>
                However, in 2020 Chennai was still not getting as much water.
                Water scarcity was still continuing in parts of the
                city.</strong

            <h3 class="titles">Yemen - Western Asia</h3>
            <p>
              The Yemeni Civil War has led to tens of thousands of deaths, but
              the international community is just starting to appreciate the
              gravity of a humanitarian crisis that has preoccupied Yemeni
              policymakers for years: water scarcity. As Iranian-backed Houthi
              rebels battle Emirati- and Saudi-trained militias across Yemen,
              the country’s already-strained water-supply networks are running
              dry. <br />
              <br />
              In 2013, two years before the Yemeni Civil War began in earnest,
              some experts predicted that the Yemeni capital of Sana’a would
              lose its water supply within 10 years. Since then, a deadly
              combination of climate change and political violence has
              aggravated water scarcity in the country. <br /><br />
              "Yemen is considered the most water-poor country in the world,"
              claims Abdoul Razaz Saleh, a former Yemeni water and environment
              minister. "It is one of the countries with no rivers, and rainfall
              has decreased significantly over the last three decades. Many
              Yemeni cities and villages suffer from water scarcity—especially
              in the winter. These days, Taiz is practically without water."

              Besieged by the Houthis since 2016, the Yemeni city of Taiz has
              struggled with water scarcity for decades. The World Bank noted
              the “dire and worsening water situation” there as far back as
              2000. The siege has inflamed this problem, forcing Taiz’s
              residents to buy water on the black market. <br />
              <br />
              "Agriculture—namely crops such as khat, fruit, and
              vegetables—consumes the lion’s share of the available water in
              Yemen, about 90 percent,” says Tawfeeq al-Sharjabi, the Yemeni
              deputy water and environment minister. “For their part, only 55
              percent of Yemeni households have access to safe drinking water,
              and this number shrinks to 35 percent in rural areas. Most of the
              wells drilled for agricultural purposes are illegal, but the
              Yemeni government’s ability to enforce these rules is weak."

              Political violence has slowed the Yemeni Water and Environment
              Ministry’s ability to deal with the humanitarian crisis as both
              parties to the conflict weaponize access to water. "The Yemeni
              government is struggling with a lack of possibilities at the
              moment," notes Saleh. "Local authorities have found temporary
              solutions by drilling wells, but they are not enough to meet the
              needs of Yemeni citizens. Yemen must arrive at a strategic
              solution through the desalination of seawater, but this proposal
              requires stability that has not existed in Yemen for over four
              years." <br /><br />
              <strong
                >If the international community wants to stop the Yemeni Civil
                War from becoming a permanent ecological and humanitarian
                crisis, regional and world powers must accelerate Yemen’s peace
                process and help the Yemeni Water and Environment Ministry
                respond to climate change and water scarcity.</strong
              >
              Though intergovernmental organizations such as the UN Development
              and Environment Programs have supported Yemeni efforts to prepare
              for global warming,<strong>
                the international community must go further.</strong
